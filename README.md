Meet Zenbo, a new robot friend for seniors, kids, and anybody else who wants to invite a real-world version of BB-8 into their own home. The robot can as a smart home manager, security guard, hands-free kitchen assistant, and even a family photographer.
        <br /><br />
        The robot can also sing songs, dance to music, and tell stories, even promising to work as a tutor to children. The device stands about knee height to an average adult, comes equipped with a robotic voice that\'s somehow already grating, and will cost $599 when it rolls into homes.
